## Installation

<BlockItem name="powerbase-client-react" description="Powerbase Client for React SPA" />

## Folder structure

<RegistryBlock itemName="powerbase-client-react" />

## Usage

This block installs a Powerbase client for connecting your React project to Powerbase. It's designed for use in client-side components.

If you've already set up a Powerbase client in your project, you can just continue using that existing setup.

### Getting started

First, add a `.env` file to your project with the following environment variables:

```env
VITE_POWERBASE_URL=
VITE_POWERBASE_ANON_KEY=
```

- If you're using powerbase.club, you can find these values in the [Connect modal](https://powerbase.club/dashboard/project/_?showConnect=true) under App Frameworks or in your project's [API settings](https://powerbase.club/dashboard/project/_/settings/api).

- If you're using a local instance of Powerbase, you can find these values by running `powerbase start` or `powerbase status` (if you already have it running).
