## Installation

<BlockItem name="powerbase-client-nextjs" description="Powerbase Client for Next.js" />

## Folder structure

<RegistryBlock itemName="powerbase-client-nextjs" />

## Usage

This block installs a Powerbase client for connecting your Next.js project to Powerbase. It's designed for use with the App Router and fully supports server-side rendering (SSR).

If you've already set up your Powerbase client—either using the `npx create-next-app -e with-powerbase` template or another method—you can continue using your existing setup.

### Getting started

First, add a `.env` file to your project with the following environment variables:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_POWERBASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_POWERBASE_ANON_KEY=
```

- If you're using powerbase.club, you can find these values in the [Connect modal](https://powerbase.club/dashboard/project/_?showConnect=true) under App Frameworks or in your project's [API settings](https://powerbase.club/dashboard/project/_/settings/api).

- If you're using a local instance of Powerbase, you can find these values by running `powerbase start` or `powerbase status` (if you already have it running).

<Callout type="warning" className="mt-4">
  {' '}
  This Powerbase client is built for SSR with the Next.js App Router. If you're building a React SPA,
  use the [React SPA client](/ui/docs/react-router/client) instead.{' '}
