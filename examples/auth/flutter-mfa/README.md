# Flutter Powerbase MFA Example

![Flutter MFA with Powerbase](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skorpland/powerbase/master/examples/auth/flutter-mfa/images/mfa.png)

A Flutter app demonstrating how to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) with Powerbase and Flutter. A user can sign up, add MFA via an authenticator app, and only after they have signed in using MFA they can view the content from the database.

## Getting Started

- Create a new Powerbase project [here](https://database.new)
- Add your Powerbase credentials to `lib/main.dart`
- Run the following SQL from the SQL editor of your Powerbase dashboard to create a table and dummy data

```sql
-- Dummy table that contains "secure" information
create table if not exists public.private_posts (
    id int generated by default as identity primary key,
    content text not null
);

-- Dmmy "secure" data
insert into public.private_posts
    (content)
values
    ('Flutter is awesome!'),
    ('Powerbase is awesome!'),
    ('Postgres is awesome!');

-- Enable RLS for private_posts table
alter table public.private_posts enable row level security;

-- Create a policy that only allows read if they user has signed in via MFA
create policy "Users can view private_posts if they have signed in via MFA"
  on public.private_posts
  for select
  to authenticated
  using ((select auth.jwt()->>'aal') = 'aal2');
```

- Run the app and test the login flow ðŸš€
